This is Brandon Hays's final exam for RMU.

Yet to implement:

- Filtering/reducing for rows and columns
- Column append, insert, delete
- Look into Row class. Fundamentally different from Column, so should I kick it out?
- Fix squirrelly block in columns... why would that be any different than the one in rows?
- Check if further work on block operators is needed.
